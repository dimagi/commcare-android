Local Setup

Some elements of your environment will need to be configured locally for some features.

A) Google Maps API Keys

You can load a debug API key for google maps into the application for testing using the maps_api_key_debug resource.

A convenient way to do so is to copy the 

external_strings_dev.xml.template

file in the res\values directory to the file location

external_strings_dev.xml

and place your debug API key into the string definition there.

B) Ant Build Properties
