 * A time bound operation will run a synchronized operation on a blocking thread with the confidence

 * method, and will return control to the main thead after the timeout has expired.
 *
 * The operation should consist of two steps: A first step that should have no side effects
 * (run), and an optional second step (commit) that executes after the first is
 * completed. The second step will not be bounded, but is guaranteed to not execute if the first
 * step did not complete in time.
 *
 * A time bound operation can only be executed once.
