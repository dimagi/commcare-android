# You can use this to override default values such as

#  'out.dir' for the location of your output folder.

# You can also use it define how the release builds are signed by declaring

#  'key.store' for the location of your keystore and
#  'key.alias' for the name of the key to use.
# The password will be asked during the build when you use the 'release' target.
